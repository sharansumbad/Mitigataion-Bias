# Mitigataion-Bias
AI and machine learning have become increasingly important in our daily lives as time has gone. People in today's environment are inadvertently exposed to this new generation of technology in one way or another. Home assistants (Alexa, Siri, etc. ), recommendation systems (Amazon, Youtube, etc. , chatbots, and so on are some of the most frequent instances. According to certain projections, the AI market is expected to develop quickly in the near future, with a market capitalization of $190 billion. The cost reduction(source) element and increasing efficacy of current models are driving this quick AI drive.AI is being used by 61% of corporate leaders with an innovation strategy to find possibilities in data that would otherwise go unnoticed . This research has allowed AI to make key choices in a variety of fields, including finance, law, and administration. However, some individuals remain skeptical of its fairness, clarity, security, and accountability.
the researchers of IBM have developed a toolkit called AI Fairness 360. It is the first system to bring together bias metrics, bias mitigation algorithms, bias metric explanation and industrial usability under one toolkit. The goal is to provide a comprehensive study of fairness metric and mitigation algorithms which helps the industry to make an ideal AI system. AIF360 is an open-source library containing algorithms for each and every step involved in the AI lifecycle
